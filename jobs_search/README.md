# Job Scraper App
The Job Scraper App is a tool designed to connect to various job websites, retrieve job offer information, and filter the results based on keywords provided by the user. The app leverages the *Scrapy framework* to efficiently scrape job listings and present the most relevant opportunities according to the user's preferences.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.12.3 
- Scrapy 2.11.2

**Note**: Versions detailed here are not mandatory, could run with other versions.

## Usage
Help:
```bash
python job_scraper.py --help
```

Searching for jobs:
```bash
python job_scraper.py --search search_term --location location --keywords keyword_0 keyword_1 ...
```
Where:
- `--search_term` is the job title or keyword to search for.
- `--location` is the location to search for the job.
- `--keywords` (optional) is a list of additional keywords to filter the results by.

### Output
It will retrieve the **title**, **company**, **location**, and **description** of the job. 
Generated files are:
- `jobs_offers.json`: a JSON file with the job listings.
- `filtered_jobs_offers.csv`: a CSV file with the filtered job listings based on the user's preferences.

### Filtering Notes
The app filter by the search term and keywords (if they are provided) looking them up in the job title and description. If any of them matches, the job is considered relevant.  
A recommendation of use is to **provide other names of the role (even translations) as keywords to filter the results**. For instace, searching for a `data scientist` in `spain`: 
```bash
python job_scraper.py -s 'data scientist' -l spain -k 'data science' 'ciencia de datos' 'científico de datos' 'machine learning' 'aprendizaje automático'
```

## Further Improvements
- Add support for different job websites: this can be done adding new spiders by new web site and concatenating the results.
- AI filtering: the app already filter by keywords, but it can be improved futher using a generation LLM and a fixed prompt given by the user according to their preferences. The AI will flag which jobs are relevant to the user.
- Improve performance: the app can scrape data faster by decreasing `DOWNLOAD_DELAY` and deactivating `AUTOTHROTTLE_ENABLED` but it will require more resources to avoid getting blocked by the website. For instance, including proxy services.
